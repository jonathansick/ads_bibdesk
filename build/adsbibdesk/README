ADS to BibDesk: Command Line edition
====================================

This is the command line edition of ADS to BibDesk, a tool for retrieving the bibtex, abstract and PDF of an astronomical journal article published on `ADS<http://adsabs.harvard.edu>`_ or `arXiv.org<http://arxiv.org/archive/astro-ph>`_ and add it to your `BibDesk<http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/>`_ database.

Quickstart
----------

ADS to BibDesk can also be run directly from the command line.
The command line script can be installed via::

    python setup.py install

You may need to run the last command with `sudo`.

Once `adsbibdesk` is installed, you can call it with the same types of article tokens you can launch the Service with, e.g.,::

    adsbibdesk 1998ApJ...500..525S

A full summary of `adsbibdesk` commands is available via::

    adsbibdesk --help

Summary of article tokens
-------------------------

* The URL of an ADS or arXiv article page,
* The ADS bibcode of an article (e.g. `1998ApJ...500..525S`),
* The arXiv identifier of an article (e.g. `0911.4956`), or
* An article DOI.

Other Modes
-----------

Besides the primary mode (adding a single paper to BibDesk, ADS to BibDesk has three other modes: previewing papers, updated preprints, and ingesting PDF archives into BibDesk.

Previewing Papers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the `-o` switch to simply download and view the PDF of an article without adding it to BibDesk. E.g.,::

    adsbibdesk -o 1998ApJ...500..525S

Updating Preprints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run ADS to BibDesk with the `-u` switch to find and update all astro-ph preprints in your BibDesk bibliography::

    adsbibdesk -u

To restrict this update to a date range, you can use the `--from_date` (`-f`) and `--to_date` (`-t`) flags with dates in `MM/YY` format. For example, to update preprints published in 2012, run::

    adsbibdesk -u --from_date=01/12 --to_date=12/12

Note that this operation can take some time since we throttle requests to ADS to be a nicer robot.

PDF Ingest Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the command-line ADS to BibDesk, you can ingest a folder of PDFs that originated from ADS into BibDesk.
This is great for users who have amassed a literature folder, but are just starting to use BibDesk.
This will get you started quickly.

You need the program `pdf2json<http://code.google.com/p/pdf2json/>`_ to use
this script. The easiest way to get pdf2json and its dependencies is through
`Homebrew<http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/>`_, the Mac package manager.
Once homebrew is setup, simply run `brew install pdf2json`.

To run this workflow,::

    adsbibdesk -p my_pdf_dir/

where `my_pdf_dir/` is a directory containing PDFs that you want to ingest.

Note that this workflow relies on a DOI existing in the PDF.
As such, it will not identify astro-ph pre-prints, or published papers older than a few years.
Typically the DOI is published on the first page of modern papers.
This method was inspired by a script by `Dr Lucy Lim<http://www.mit.edu/people/lucylim/BibDesk.html`_.

Developer Notes
---------------

ADS to BibDesk is developed on GitHub at `https://github.com/jonathansick/ads_bibdesk<https://github.com/jonathansick/ads_bibdesk>`_. See the README there for information on how to compile the Python code across Service, App and command line versions.
